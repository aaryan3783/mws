                <p>About 60 years back I was young and was studying in Government Higher Secondary School Aalo. I was in great pain and misery. My family background was not better. xMy father was a farmer. He did not know how to live with ease and comforts. He never went to school. He lived in forest with great harmony with nature. There was a tradition in that time to wear only a very thin and small cloth to cover some part of body. Maximum part of the body was uncovered. When any disease came in his body, he did not use any medicines, as there were no medicines at all, no medical facility at all. He was totally dependent on the nature. He went to the forest, hunted some animals, collected some leaves and roots from there and come to home at evening. That was the routine works and activities of my father. I would like to say  in this regard that it was not the only routine work of my father, but it was the routine works of all the villagers at that time. None of the villagers used to know how to write and read with or without understanding. Owing to illiteracy and ignorance not only my father and mother, but all the villagers of my areas remained always in grief and pain. When small pox came, the village after village was washed away, no people remained alive. In the same manner when haiza |(continuous dysentery) came in  the basti or villages , hardly few strong people remained alive , almost all were dead . This is the only one side of the story. The other side of the story was that there was no any means of livelihood in the villages. They did not know how to grow crops.  They did not know how to prepare food and provision materials.  They did not know how to wear clothes. They did not know how to domesticate animals for their life. They were solely dependent on the nature. Whatever materials they found from their immediate surroundings, they used them and lived with nature without any complaints.

        </h2>
        <div class="container flex about-orginization">
            <p data-aos="fade-right">I, Doi Ado, Former Minister, Government of Arunachal Pradesh completed my elementary education in my Basti (village). After its completion, I was sent to district’s headquarter Aalo to continue my further study. I came here and began to prosecute study sincerely. I thought of during my student life that the root cause of all the type of misery found in the bastis and villages was illiteracy and ignorance. Like a philosopher, I began to think that if I want to eradicate poverty and misery from the society, I shall have to improve the educational status of the villagers first. In the name of schools there were only lower primary and middle schools in the villages. The secondary school was very few in the state. There was no any college in many districts. I pondered over this and resolved that I would open a teachers training college in future. That is the only way to eliminate all the types of the evils from the society. My thinking was that if there would be training college, a large number of teachers would be trained and produced there; they would go to the different corners of the district or state and spread the light of knowledge and education.  Thus, gradually all the type of the evils would be terminated automatically. With this thought and ideas I began to work day in and day out. I completed my graduation. I was the first graduate of my block and locality.

                <br><br>
                <div class="container flex about-orginization">
                    <p data-aos="fade-left">

                I found problems everywhere. I saw the grief, pain and misery of my villagers and locality. I thought of that first of all people should be awakened for learning and they should be inspired for increasing their earning, because without learning earning would be meaningless. If they would be educated, their miseries would be vanished. For this noble cause I started campaign at local level. I used to meet people and tried to put the matter of educational development in their mind. The villagers were vey innocent and sentimental. Very easily they conceded my feelings and ideas. They supported my ideology.

                <p data-aos="fade-right">
            Secondly I thought of that power is important to do something more for the common people of the state and nation. So, I decided to be a leader. I was popular among masses, as I always involved in public activities. People liked my dedications and works. The people supported me in election of legislative assembly. I became victorious with greater margin.  I became M. L.A... Thereafter continuously I got the blessings and supports of the public and remained in power by 15 years. In that period I served as a minister in different departments. I wanted to develop the state educationally since my student life. So, at one time I demanded the education department from my hon’ble Chief Minister. He accepted my proposal and allotted me the Education Department of my state Arunachal Pradesh. As an education minister I tried to upgrade the education. I tried to open new schools in Bastis or villages in remote areas of the state. I opened many colleges in the state and supported the university. I encouraged people for their educational development. During my tenure I tried my level best to improve the educational scenario of the state, but in a five years duration all the things cannot be done.
        </p>

                <p data-aos="fade-left">
            Now I was not in power, but my works and thoughts were uncomplete. Hence, I decided to establish an NGO (Non-Governmental Organisation). Thus, I started Marjum Welfare Society at Aalo. Under the Society Registration Act 1860  (as modified by the Societies Registration , Extension to Arunachal Pradesh, Act 1978) this society was registered on 28th January’ 1999 by the Registrar of Societies, Government of Arunachal Pradesh, Itanagar. The main motto of this organisation was to save the society from the influence of alien culture and uplift them educationally. So I opened the Teachers Training College B. Ed. Aalo in 2011 as there were no any teacher education institute in nearby districts. From that time onwards thousands of the teachers have been trained in this college. They are serving in the Arunachal Pradesh and other part of the nation. In the year 2023 this society is also going to open Doi Ado Arts College and Doi Ado Science College very close to the B. Ed. college. Thus, I tried to fulfil my dream with this society and this is how  Marjum Welfare Society came into being.
